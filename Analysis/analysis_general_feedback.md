# Analysis General Feedback

The following points may be applicable to your submission as well as the individual feedback you received via e-mail.

## Layout

- Make sure that images are cropped before adding them to the document
- Use the LaTeX table syntax
- Watch margins - there should be nothing in the white areas around the page
- Get the **updated** settings.tex file for revised pseudo-code syntax
- Make use of the pseudo-code syntax

## Client Identification

- Make sure that the role of the client is clear
- Link the role to the system that is going to be developed

## Definition of Current System

- It should be possible to visualise exactly what the current system does from your description
- Be as detailed as possible
- Don’t discuss problems in this section

## Description of Problems

- Clearly list and explain each problem
- Use bullets to help structure the section
- Be clear on why each problem is an issue

## Data Sources and Destinations (Current System)

- Use a table format
- Make sure data items are identified individually (first name, last name etc.)
- Think carefully about the sources and destinations – does user pass data to the client directly or is there another destination; a form for instance.

## Algorithms (Current System)

- This is a difficult section
- All current systems will have algorithms but they may be hard to identify
- Think about ordering/marking/testing etc.

## Data Flow Diagrams (Current System)

- Use the correct symbols (see Moodle and the text book)
- Ensure that processes are included
- Label arrows
- Split diagram up into sub-diagrams as needed

## Input Forms, Output Forms, Report Formats

- Be sure to scan in any forms, invoices etc. that you have been provided with
- Annotate these forms to explain them

## Data Sources and Destinations (Proposed System)

- Same issues as the current system

## Data Flow Diagrams (Proposed System)

- Same issues as the current system

## Data Dictionary

- Make sure that data items are atomic
- Be sure to fill all columns of the table
- There will be lots of data items for most systems (a page or two)

## Volumetrics

- Be sure to evidence statements made about number of records using quotes from the interview
- You must attempt to estimate the actual storage size required using the figures from the data dictionary
- Get real estimates for each field - don't guess **1KB** for instance!

## General Objectives

- These should be SMART
- Cover the main functionality of the program

## Specific Objectives
- These should be SMART
- Break each general objective down – specific objectives are the detailed objectives for each area of functionality
- You should be able to actually program a specific objective e.g. ‘add student to database’

## Core Objectives

- These are the specific objectives that must be completed for the system to have a minimum acceptable level of functionality

## Other Objectives

- These are the specific objectives that you will complete if you have time

## ER Diagram

- Use what we learned about normalization and relationships to help you here

## Entity Descriptions

- Use what we learned last week about normalization and relationships to help you here
- The entities identified here should match those from the diagram section
- Ensure **foreign keys** are present

## Object Analysis

- Make sure that your objects could be objects in the real world and that they are not attributes

## Relationship Diagrams

- Think about the relationships – arrows are a particular relationship

## Class Definitions

- Make sure that the notation is correct – don’t just use a table

## Graphs

- Can you create abstractions (e.g. graphs/trees) to help represent aspects of the system

## Hardware Constraints

- Think about the hardware you need to use – how does a 17” wide screen impact the development, for example?

## Software Constraints

- How does the software selected impact on development?

## Time Constraints

- This is the implementation deadline which is February half-term (find out the actual date)

## User Knowledge

- How does the level of user knowledge impact on you? Do you need to design the UI in a particular way to help them understand?

## Access Restrictions

- Think about the data protection act

## Areas which will not be included in computerization

- Describe areas which are either too expensive or not feasible to include in the system here

## Areas considered for future computerization

- This is different from the previous section
- Think about possible improvements to the system that are achievable

## Alternative Solutions

- List all alternatives, including the ‘actual’ solution
- Describe them fully so that it is possible to visualize how they would work
- There should be at least:
    - Improving the manual system
    - Web-based solution
    - Customised database (and/or spreadsheet) solution
    - GUI based solution

## Justification of Chosen Solution

- Make sure you explain clearly and in a good amount of detail why you have made a particular choice from the alternatives
